**Known issues** <br>

**-----Large Files-----** <br>
A standard GitHub repository has a file size limit of 100MB. To enable our collaborators to share large files, we will use Github Large File Storage (LFS). <br>
See About Git Large File Storage: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-git-large-file-storage#pointer-file-format <br>
Collaborators: “If collaborators on your repository don't have Git LFS installed, they won't have access to the original large file. If they attempt to clone your repository, they will only fetch the pointer files, and won't have access to any of the actual data.” See Collaboration with Git Large File Storage: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/collaboration-with-git-large-file-storage <br>
Installation: issue “git lfs install” on the branch with the large file. Setup LFS before adding or committing your branch, failure to do so will result in the inability to commit your large file(s). See Installing Git Large File Storage: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage
Configuration: Git LFS will have to be associated with the large file you want to upload before you can push it. See Configuring Git Large File Storage: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage <br>
Step-by-step Commit Instructions:<br>
1. Issue ‘git checkout -b your-feature-branch’ <br>
2. Issue ‘git lfs install’ if you haven't already done so <br>
2. Issue ‘git lfs track path/to/file’ <br>
3. Issue ‘git add .gitattributes’ <br>
4. Issue ‘add path/to/file’ <br>
5. Issue ‘git commit -m “your commit message”’ <br>
